                      <h3>About Me:</h3>
                      <p>I am a Freelance Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer. I was introduced to Ruby on Rails in 2015. Prior to Ruby I have worked on WordPress projects as well as learning basic web development HTML 5, CSS, PHP, jQuery and JavaScript.</p>

                      <p>In June 2014 2 friends and I came up with an idea to create an E-Commerce store selling mens clothing and accessories, from there I decided if I'm going to enter the E-commerce world I should learn how to develop my own website and thats exactly what I did. By learning WordPress and minor PHP coding myself along with my partners were able to launch our very own E-commerce store. </p>

              <div class="col-lg-5 text-left">
                      <p> Prior to web development I was a full time musician as well as a retail manager in Telecommunications. My passion for music started when I was 6 years of age. My father had his old drum set sitting in the attic. When I spotted them collecting dust I immediately asked "Hey Dad what are those?" From that point on I was non-stop music. At the age of 23, I attended college, graduating with an associates degree in Business Marketing Administration and jumped into sales and store management for Canada's number 1 telecommunication company Bell Mobility/Virgin Canada.
                      </p>

                      <p>My hobbies and interest include long hikes, camping, traveling, watching live music, redditing and enjoying some down time with my guitar. On occasion I can be found in local coffee shops around areas of Toronto, Canada and the United Kingdom working on various coding projects and continuing to improve on my coding knowledge.</p>

                      <p>If you have a question(s) or would like to learn more about what I do, please feel free to contact me on here or by <a href="mailto:byrne.daniel87@gmail.com?Subject=Contact%20DanielJohnApps"target="_top">Email.</a> Thanks a lot!</p>
