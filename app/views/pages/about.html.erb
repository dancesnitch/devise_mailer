                      <p>My name is Daniel John Byrne I am a Freelance Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer. I was introduced to Ruby on Rails in 2015 prior to Ruby I was working on WordPress projects and learning basic web development HTML 5 and CSS.
                      </p>

                      <p> In June 2014 me and 2 friends came up with an idea to create an E-Commerce store selling mens clothing and accessories, from there I decided if I'm going to enter the E-commerce world I should learn how to develop my own website and thats exactly what I did; By learning WordPress and minor PHP coding myself along with my partners were able to launch our very own E-commerce store. </p>

                      <p> Prior to web development I was full time musician as well as a retail manager in Telecommunications. My passion for music started when I was 6 years of age, my father had his old drum set sitting the attic, I then asked "Hey Dad what are those?" from that point on I was non-stop music until I was 23 then I went back to college, earned a diploma in Business Marketing Administration and jumped into sales and store management for Canada's number 1 telecommunication company, Bell Mobility/Virgin Canada. </p>

                      <p>My hobbies and interest include long hikes, camping, traveling, watching live music, redditing and enjoying some down time with my guitar. </p>
